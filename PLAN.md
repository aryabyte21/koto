# koto — The i18n Translation Tool That Should Already Exist

## Context & Why This Matters

Every team with a multi-language app faces the same broken workflow: edit English strings, manually run some script or push to an expensive SaaS, pray the AI/MT doesn't butcher legal text with casual slang, wait for JSON files to appear, hope nothing broke. It's 2026 and this still sucks.

A previous internal project solved one piece nobody else has: **context-aware translation** — legal text gets formal tone, consumer UI gets friendly tone, developer docs get technical tone. But it's a Python script duct-taped to Gemini. The opportunity is to generalize this into an open-source tool that combines the best ideas from every competitor while adding what none of them have.

**The thesis:** No tool combines these three things that developers desperately want:
1. **Context-aware AI translation** (different tones per section) — nobody has this
2. **Type-safe translation keys** (TypeScript types generated from locale files) — Paraglide has this but no AI; Lingo.dev has AI but no types
3. **Zero-config "just works" DX** with beautiful terminal output — the "shadcn/Biome effect"

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation — Scaffold + Config + Core Pipeline ✅
**Goal:** Working translation of a single JSON file with one provider

1. ✅ Init pnpm workspace monorepo (packages/cli, packages/action, docs)
2. ✅ Scaffold cli package: `package.json`, `tsup.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`
3. ✅ `core/config/schema.ts` — Zod config schema + `defineConfig()` export
4. ✅ `core/config/loader.ts` — find and load config file (support .ts, .json, .js)
5. ✅ `formats/base.ts` — FileFormat interface
6. ✅ `formats/json-nested.ts` — Nested JSON parser (round-trip)
7. ✅ `core/placeholders/` — pattern registry + shield + restore
8. ✅ `core/cache/hasher.ts` — SHA-256 content hashing
9. ✅ `core/cache/lockfile.ts` — lockfile read/write/diff
10. ✅ `core/pipeline/` — extractor, differ, batcher, validator, writer, orchestrator
11. ✅ `providers/base.ts` — Provider interface
12. ✅ `providers/openai.ts` — First provider (most popular)
13. ✅ Unit tests for all of the above
14. ✅ **Milestone:** `npx koto translate` works end-to-end for a JSON file with OpenAI

### Phase 2: DX Polish — CLI UI + Init + Auto-Detection ✅
**Goal:** The "30-second experience" works beautifully

15. ✅ `ui/` — @clack/prompts integration (intro, progress, summary, diff-view)
16. ✅ `core/detect/` — framework, i18n library, and locale auto-detection
17. ✅ `commands/init.ts` — interactive setup with auto-detection
18. ✅ `commands/translate.ts` — wire up with beautiful progress UI
19. ✅ `commands/diff.ts` — visual diff of pending translations
20. ✅ `commands/validate.ts` — config + provider health check
21. ✅ `commands/cache.ts` — cache stats and management
22. ✅ `utils/cost.ts` — cost estimation per provider
23. ✅ **Milestone:** Full CLI experience from init to translate with progress UI

### Phase 3: Context System + More Providers ✅
**Goal:** The killer differentiator is live

24. ✅ `core/context/` — context resolution, prompt builder, glossary loading
25. ✅ `providers/anthropic.ts` — Claude provider
26. ✅ `providers/google.ts` — Gemini (API key + Vertex AI)
27. ✅ `providers/ollama.ts` — Ollama (local, free)
28. ✅ `providers/custom.ts` — Generic HTTP adapter
29. ✅ Quality scoring: `core/quality/scorer.ts` + `core/quality/rules.ts`
30. ✅ Integration tests for context system + all providers (mock provider for CI)
31. ✅ **Milestone:** Context-aware translation working, multiple providers

### Phase 4: Type Generation + Additional Formats ✅
**Goal:** Type safety + broad file format support

32. ✅ `core/typegen/` — generate TypeScript type definitions from locale files
33. ✅ `commands/types.ts` — `koto types` and `koto types --watch`
34. ✅ `formats/json-flat.ts` — flat JSON
35. ✅ `formats/yaml.ts` — YAML (zero-dep parser)
36. ✅ `formats/po.ts` — GNU Gettext PO files
37. ✅ **Milestone:** `npx koto types` generates working TS types

### Phase 5: GitHub Action + CI ✅
**Goal:** One-line CI integration

38. ✅ `packages/action/` — GitHub Action scaffold
39. ✅ `action.yml` with inputs for provider, API key, locales
40. ✅ CI/CD workflows (ci.yml, release.yml)
41. ✅ **Milestone:** GitHub Action ready

### Phase 6: Docs Site + Landing Page
**Goal:** Beautiful docs + landing page ready

42. ✅ Astro Starlight docs site in `docs/` (9 pages)
43. ✅ Landing page: hero + feature cards + install command
44. ✅ Getting started, configuration, contexts, type-safety, providers, CI/CD, CLI reference, comparison
45. ⬜ Record 30-second demo GIF for README
46. ✅ README: logo → one-liner → features → comparison table
47. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow to deploy docs to GitHub Pages
48. ✅ **Milestone:** Docs site builds, README polished

### Phase 7: Viral Features — Badge + OSS Contributor
**Goal:** Two growth engines live before launch

49. ⬜ i18n Coverage Badge API (serverless SVG generator — needs hosting)
50. ⬜ Coverage report page (needs hosting)
51. ✅ `npx koto badge` command — generates shields.io badge + coverage report
52. ✅ `npx koto contribute <repo> --locale <code>` command
53. ✅ GitHub API integration: fork → detect → translate → PR (via gh CLI)
54. ✅ PR template with quality report + "Powered by koto" footer
55. ✅ **Milestone:** Badge generating + contribute command ready

## AGENT LEARNINGS

> **Agent instruction:** At the end of every chunk, append a dated entry below summarizing anything that would help agents working on later chunks avoid roadblocks or wasted effort. Include surprises about the codebase, non-obvious dependency chains, patterns that worked well, mistakes to avoid, and any deviations from the plan that were necessary. Keep entries concise and actionable. Delete any previous learnings that are no longer relevant or applicable.

### 2026-03-14 — Initial Implementation (Phases 1–5)

**Build setup:**
- pnpm workspace with `packages/cli` and `packages/action`. Root `turbo.json` for build orchestration.
- `tsup` for bundling — use array config (two entries) to apply shebang only to `cli.js`, not `index.js` (library entry).
- `tsc` binary lives at `node_modules/.bin/tsc` under the root workspace (not the cli package) because `typescript` is a root devDep. The cli package's tsup/vitest have their own binaries under `packages/cli/node_modules/.bin/`.
- `jiti` v2 uses `createJiti()` API (not `import jiti from 'jiti'`). The subagent got this right.

**Architecture decisions:**
- All providers use the same numbered-list format for batch translation (e.g., `1. Hello\n2. Goodbye`). Response parsing strips numbering with regex `/^(\d+)\.\s*(.+)$/`. This is battle-tested from internal use.
- Placeholder shielding replaces placeholders with `__PH_N__` tokens before sending to LLM, restores after. Overlap resolution: sort by start position, then by longest match. This prevents `{{var}}` being partially matched by the `{var}` pattern.
- Lockfile is JSON (not YAML) — no parsing deps, git-diffable, fast. Atomic writes via tmp-file + rename.
- Config loading via `jiti` enables TypeScript config files with `defineConfig()` for autocomplete.

**Module interfaces — what other modules expect:**
- `scoreTranslation(source, translation, targetLocale, rules?, key?)` — the `key` param is optional and defaults to `""`. Called from `pipeline/index.ts` without the key arg.
- `diffLockfile()` returns `DiffResult` which extends `LocaleDiff` and has `byLocale` map. Pipeline uses the top-level `added/changed/removed/unchanged` arrays (which come from the first locale).
- `resolveContext()` takes a file path and contexts record, returns `ResolvedContext` with `glossaryTerms` as optional `Record<string, string>` that gets populated later by the pipeline.
- Format `serialize(keys, original?)` — when `original` is provided, it round-trips through the original structure (preserving key order and indentation). When not provided, it builds a new nested object.

**Gotchas:**
- `fd` command is aliased on this machine and doesn't support `-n` flag. Use `Glob` tool instead of shell `find`.
- Shell cwd resets to project after every command. Always use absolute paths.
- The `@clack/prompts` package exports `isCancel` for checking if user cancelled interactive prompts.
- `picocolors` is the lightweight color library (no chalk dependency). Import as `import pc from 'picocolors'`.

**What worked well:**
- Parallelizing 4 subagents for independent module groups (config, providers+formats, placeholders+cache+quality, context+detect+utils) — all produced clean, compatible code.
- Writing the pipeline orchestrator and CLI commands in the main thread while subagents handled core modules.
- Type-checking with `tsc --noEmit` after subagents finished — caught zero errors, meaning the interfaces were specified clearly enough.

**What to watch out for in future chunks:**
- The `formats/registry.ts` currently returns `jsonNestedFormat` for all `.json` files. When adding YAML/PO/XLIFF, the registry needs format auto-detection logic (maybe based on file content, not just extension, to distinguish flat vs nested JSON).
- The `custom.ts` provider and `yaml.ts`/`po.ts` formats are listed in the plan but not yet implemented.
- Integration tests using the `MockProvider` in `test/helpers/mock-provider.ts` should cover the full pipeline end-to-end.
- The docs site (Phase 6) and viral features (Phase 7) have not been started.
- The `TranslationProgress` UI uses ANSI escape codes for cursor movement — this won't work in non-TTY environments (CI). The `--fail-on-error` flag path should use a simpler reporter.

### 2026-03-14 — Phase 4-7 Implementation

**Docs site (Astro Starlight 0.32 + Astro 5):**
- Starlight 0.32 requires Content Layer API: `src/content.config.ts` with `docsLoader()` + `docsSchema()`.
- The `social` field in Starlight config is an **object** (`{ github: 'url' }`), NOT an array.
- Sidebar items use `link: '/path/'`, NOT `slug: 'page-id'` — the `slug` format caused build errors.
- After changing content config, you MUST clean cache: `rm -rf .astro node_modules/.astro`.

**Formats:**
- YAML parser is zero-dep (custom implementation), handles nested keys, quoted strings, multiline.
- PO format supports `msgctxt` as key prefix, multiline continuation lines, header preservation.
- TypeScript format uses regex to extract object literals — handles single quotes, trailing commas.
- Format registry maps `.yml`/`.yaml` to YAML, `.po`/`.pot` to PO, `.ts`/`.js` to TypeScript.

**Contribute command:**
- Uses `node:child_process` `execFile` (NOT shell-based) for safety.
- Shells out to `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (fork, clone, PR create).

**What's still remaining:**
- Badge API serverless function (needs hosting — Cloudflare Workers or Vercel)
- Coverage report page (needs hosting)
- Demo GIF recording
- Real-world E2E test with actual LLM API key
